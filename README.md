# ABOUT

Our clients, the School of Code, gave us the brief:

>'Improve remote team building at the School of Code'

We solved this problem by creating a *gaming platform* and bespoke *'Facts!'* game to ultimately break down communication barriers and build rapport. This file contains the back-end section of the project.

The front-end was built with React Library, utilising the development environment, Storybook, and a number of UI libraries such as Material UI and Chakra, and both the platform and Facts! game are tested extensively using Jest.

Inside the file you will find two separate react-apps, the first being the Facts! game and the second being the platform. We created it in such a way to make the platform scalable, creating a separation of concerns, so that each service is carry out one task.

Both services were deployed using netlify. You can view them by following the links and signing up below:
